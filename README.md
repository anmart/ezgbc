## EZGB

Starter project for Gameboy Color Projects. Collection of useful routines and skeletons from past and future projects of mine.

### Set-Up
Should just need make and [rgbds](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds). Then run make and you should have a gameboy color game named "ezgbc.gbc"! 

### Use
The goal of this code base is to provide a skeleton and some useful routines for your game. Ideally, use will mean copying the code and gutting the parts you don't need. Copy everything, change the makefile around, get rid of what you don't need, and happy coding!

### license
This project uses the [Unlicence](http://unlicense.org/) license. Do whatever you want but I'm not responsible!

If you'd like to, I would absolutely love to hear how you're using this code! feel free to send me an email!
